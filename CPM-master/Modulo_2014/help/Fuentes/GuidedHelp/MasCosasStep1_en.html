            So, you need to purchase tickets for more than one movie. You'll have to go back
            to the start of the line and wait for another turn.<br />
            I was joking! We thought of that and you can do it in the same order. (We ARE the  
            best ones, aren't we?)

                On this screen you can see an overview of every purchase you have done thus far.
                If you press 'Buy more tickets' you'll go back to the movie selection screen 
                to choose a new one.<br />
                For more information on choosing movies, look at this page over here:

            Don't worry, you can also remove some of those purchases. (Don't remove them all, please!)

                If you press 'Delete something', the screen will change (an imposing sight, right?) and you will
                see something like this. Before removing a purchase, you must select it by pressing over it.

                When you select a purchase, it will be marked in red. Now you can press
                'Delete this' to remove it. If you want to deselect it, just press over it
                again. Once you finish removing things, press 'Now it's fine' to continue
